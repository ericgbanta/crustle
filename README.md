# ðŸ¦€ crustle ðŸ¦€

**This project is WIP.**

Crustle is a Bug/Rock-type PokÃ©mon introduced in Generation V. It is also this project, which is named after this crab pokemon to honor Rustaceans that also like {blank}. This is a simple PokÃ©dex app built using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) (not to be confused with [Deoxys](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Deoxys_(Pok%C3%A9mon))).
